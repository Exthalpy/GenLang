# GenLang: Self-Decoding Compression Architecture
![GenLang Architecture](docs/images/architecture_diagram.png)

## Overview
GenLang offers a novel approach to managing token constraints in large language models (LLMs) through self-decoding compression. By embedding decoding instructions within compressed text, GenLang reduces token usage by approximately 50%, enabling richer interactions with lower API costs.

This repository provides the GenLang research paper, implementation examples, and scripts for compression and decompression to help developers and researchers integrate GenLang with LLMs.

## Key Features
- **Token Reduction**: Compress input data while retaining essential context.
- **Cost Savings**: Lower API usage costs up to 50%.
- **Interoperability**: Standardized format to support multi-model data exchange.
- **Preservation of Detail**: High interpretation accuracy compared to traditional summarization.
