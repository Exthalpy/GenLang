# GenLang: Self-Decoding Compression Architecture

## Abstract
GenLang is a novel self-decoding compression architecture designed to reduce token usage in large language models (LLMs). This approach embeds decoding instructions directly within compressed text, effectively expanding the usable context window while cutting API costs.

## Introduction
LLMs like GPT-4 have revolutionized complex data interaction but face limitations due to token constraints. GenLang aims to address these challenges by compressing inputs and embedding decoding instructions, allowing models to reconstruct the original content at reduced token costs.

## Key Benefits
- **Token Reduction**: Reduces token usage by 50% while preserving detail.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cuts API costs significantly by fitting more content in fewer tokens.
- **Interoperability**: Enables cross-model data exchange with a standardized compression format.

## Case Studies
### Legal Document Analysis
Compression ratio of 0.50 allowed for detailed legal document analysis without data truncation.

### Customer Support Interaction
Enhanced customer service log analysis with reduced tokens, compressing multi-turn conversations for complete context.

### Academic Research Summaries
Allowed academic paper summarization while retaining depth, useful for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

## Conclusion
GenLang presents a cost-effective, efficient, and interoperable solution for managing token constraints in LLM applications, with applications spanning from legal tech to AI model interoperability.
