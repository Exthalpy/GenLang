        "1 INTRODUCTION\n",
        "Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to reconstruct a 3D scene from a series of input views and gener- ate high-quality images from previously unseen viewpoints. High-quality and real-time reconstruc- tion and view synthesis are crucial for autonomous driving (Tonderski et al., 2023; Khan et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024a), robotics perception ( Wilder-Smith et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2023a) and virtual or augmented reality (Yang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024).\n",
        "NeRF-based methods ( Mildenhall et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020; Neff et al., 2021) have achieved remarkable success by encoding 3D scenes into implicit radiance fields, yet sampling volumes for NeRF rendering is costly in both time and memory. Recently, Kerbl et al. (2023) proposed to represent 3D scenes explicitly using a set of 3D Gaussians, enabling much more efficient and high-quality rendering via a differentiable rasterizer. Still, the original 3D Gaussian Splatting requires separate optimization on each single scene, which significantly reduces inference efficiency. To tackle this problem, recent researches have aimed at generating 3D Gaussians directly from a feed-forward network without any per-scene optimization ( Charatan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Szymanowicz et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024). Typically, these approaches adhere to a paradigm where a fixed number of Gaussians is predicted for each pixel in the input views. The Gaussians derived from different views are then directly merged to construct the final 3D scene representation. However, such a paradigm limits the model performance as the Gaussian splats are uniformly distributed across images, making it difficult to capture local geometric details effectively. Additionally, as the number of input views increases, directly merging Gaussians can degrade reconstruction performance due to severe Gaussian overlap and redundancy across views.\n",
        "To address this, we propose PixelGaussian, which enables dynamic adaption on both 3D Gaussian distribution and quantity. To be specific, we first uniformly initialize Gaussian positions following Chen et al. (2024) to accurately localize the Gaussian centers. To identify geometry complexity across images, we then compute a relevance score map for each input view from image features in an end-to-end manner. Under the guidance of score maps, we construct a Cascade Gaussian Adapter (CGA), which leverages deformable attention (Xia et al., 2022) to control the pruning and splitting operations. After CGA, more Gaussians are allocated to regions with complex geometry for precise reconstruction, while unnecessary and duplicate Gaussians across views are pruned to reduce redun- dancy and improve efficiency. Since these Gaussian representations still fall short in fully capturing the image details, we further introduce a transformer-based Iterative Gaussian Refiner (IGR) to refine 3D Gaussians through direct image-Gaussian interactions. Finally, we employ rasterization-based rendering using the refined Gaussians to generate novel views at target viewpoints.\n",
        "We conduct extensive experiments on ACID (Liu et al.) and RealEstate10K (Zhou et al., 2018) benchmarks for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. PixelGaussian out- performs existing methods on different input views with a comparable inference speed. Notably, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting methods (pixelSplat (Charatan et al., 2023) and MVS- plat (Chen et al., 2024)) fail to achieve good results when transferring to more input views while our method demonstrates consistent performance. This is because existing pixel-wise methods gen- erate uniform pixel-aligned Gaussian predictions, and our model mitigates Gaussian overlap and redundancy across views by dynamically adjusting their distribution based on local geometry com- plexity. Visualizations and ablations further demonstrate that both CGA and IGR blocks are crucial in adapting Gaussian distribution, enabling the proposed PixelGaussian to capture geometry details and achieve better reconstruction accuracy.\n",

        "Multi-View Stereo. Multi-View Stereo (MVS) aims to reconstruct a 3D representation from multi- view images of a given scene or object. Since accurate depth estimation is essential for reliable 3D reconstruction from 2D inputs, most MVS methods ( Gu et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2018) require ground truth depth for supervision in training process. Additionally, point-based MVS approaches generally separate the processes of depth estimation and point cloud fusion pro- cesses. Recently, inspired by efficient Gaussian representations proposed by Kerbl et al. (2023), Chen et al. (2024) introduces to directly predict depth for pixel-wise Gaussians from a cost volume structure without requiring depth supervision, significantly improving model scalability and flexi- bility. Therefore, following a similar approach, we construct a lightweight cost volume to facilitate depth estimation, which serves as an efficient initialization for 3D Gaussians in our PixelGaussian.\n",
        "Per-scene 3D Reconstruction. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized the field of 3D reconstruction by representing scenes as implicit neural fields (Mildenhall et al., 2020). Subse- quent researches have focused on overcoming the limitations of the original NeRF to improve its performance and broaden its applicability. Some researches aim to improve the efficiency for novel view synthesis ( Hu et al., 2022; Fridovich-Keil et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2020; Neff et al., 2021). Moreover, several studies concentrate on capturing intricate geometry and tem- poral information to achieve accurate and dynamic reconstruction ( Li et al., 2021; Du et al., 2021; Pumarola et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022). Compared to implicit NeRF-based methods, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) (Kerbl et al., 2023) represents a 3D scenario as a set of ex- plicit 3D Gaussians, enabling a rasterization-based splatting rendering process that is significantly more efficient in both time and memory. Given that 3DGS still requires millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a single scene, numerous studies have focused on achieving real-time rendering and minimizing memory usage ( Fan et al., 2023; Katsumata et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). Additionally, some researches focus on enhancing the reconstruction quality of 3DGS by employing multi-scale rendering (Yan et al., 2024), advanced shading models (Jiang et al., 2023b) or incorporating physi- cally based properties for realistic relighting (Gao et al., 2023). However, these methods still require per-scene optimization and rely on dense input views, which can be computationally expensive and limit their scalability for large-scale or dynamic scenes.\n",
        "Generalizable 3D Reconstruction. PixelNeRF (Yu et al., 2021b) pioneers the approach of pre- dicting pixel-wise features directly from input views to reconstruct neural radiance fields. Follow- ing methods incorporate volume or transformer architectures to improve the performance of feed- forward NeRF models ( Chen et al., 2021a; Xu et al., 2024; Miyato et al., 2024; Sajjadi et al., 2022; Du et al., 2023). However, these feed-forward NeRF approaches typically demand substantial mem- ory and computational resources due to the expensive per-pixel volume sampling process (Wang et al., 2021a; Johari et al., 2022; Barron et al., 2021; Garbin et al., 2021; Reiser et al., 2021; Mu ̈ller et al., 2022). With the advent of 3DGS, PixelSplat (Charatan et al., 2023) initiates a shift towards feed-forward Gaussian-based reconstruction. It takes sparse input views to directly predict pixel- wise 3D Gaussians by leveraging epipolar geometry to learn cross-view features. MVSplat (Chen et al., 2024) constructs a cost volume structure for depth estimation, which significantly boosts both model efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, MVSGaussian (Liu et al., 2024) further improves model performance by introducing an efficient hybrid Gaussian rendering process. More- over, SplatterImage (Szymanowicz et al., 2024) and GPS-Gaussian (Zheng et al., 2024) predict pixel-wise 3D Gaussians for object-centric or human reconstruction.\n",
        "However, these feed-forward methods are constrained by the pixel-wise Gaussian prediction paradigm, which limits the model’s performance as the Gaussian splats are uniformly distributed across images. Such a paradigm inadequately captures intricate geometries, while also causing Gaussian overlap and redundancy across views, ultimately resulting in severe rendering artifacts. In comparison, PixelGaussian consists of a Cascade Gaussian Adapter (CGA), allowing for dy- namic adaption on both Gaussian distribution and quantity. Visualizations demonstrate that CGA is capable of allocating more Gaussians in areas rich in geometric details, while reducing duplicate Gaussians in similar regions across input views. Furthermore, we introduce an Iterative Gaussian Refiner (IGR), enabling direct interaction between 3D Gaussians and local image features via de- formable attention. Experimental results show that IGR effectively leverages image features to guide Gaussians in capturing the full information contained within the images, significantly enhancing the model’s ability to capture local intricate geometry.\n",

This approach ensures that regions with complex geometry details are represented by a greater number of Gaussians, while areas with poor geometry can be represented with fewer Gaus- sians.

Compared to previous pixel-wise methods, which rigidly allocate a fixed number of Gaus- sians per pixel, our design dynamically adapts both distribution and quantity of Gaussians based on geometric complexity. This flexibility allows for a more accurate capture of local geometry and mitigates the problem of Gaussian overlap, thereby improving the overall quality of reconstruction.\n",

RealEstate10K provides video frames from real estate environments, with 67,477 scenes allocated for training and 7,289 scenes reserved for testing. The model is trained with two reference views, and four novel views are selected for evaluation. During testing, however, we perform multiple experiments where 2, 3, and 4 views are selected for reference, while four novel views selected for evaluation in each scenario.\n",

As for the splitting operation, the SplitNet generates M = 1 separate new Gaussians, whereas the pruning process uses reduction factors γα = γs = 0.5 and opacity threshold τα = 0.3. We use B = 3 blocks in Iterative Gaussian Refiner (IGR) to extract local geometry from input views. We implement our PixelGaussian with Pytorch and train the model on 8 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs for 300,000 iterations with Adam optimizer. More training details are provided in Section A.2.\n",

        "Novel View Synthesis. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4, our proposed PixelGaussian consistently outperforms previous NeRF-based methods and pixel-wise Gaussian feed-forward networks across all settings with 2, 3, and 4 reference views. Notably, as the number of input views increases, the re- construction performance of both pixelSplat (Charatan et al., 2023) and MVSplat (Chen et al., 2024) degrades significantly, while PixelGaussian shows a slight improvement. This is because previous methods directly merge multiple views by back-projecting pixel-wise Gaussians to 3D space based on depth maps. Without the capability to adapt the quantity and distribution of Gaussians dynam- ically, pixel-wise methods often produce duplicated Gaussians with significant overlap, and their spatial positioning is suboptimal. In contrast, PixelGaussian is able to optimize both the distribution and quantity of Gaussians via CGA, while IGR blocks facilitate direct interaction between Gaussian queries and local image features, resulting in more accurate reconstructions.\n",

In regions with richer geometric details, CGA blocks first split more Gaussians for finer representations, fol- lowed by IGR to further refine these Gaussians using deformable attention on local image features to better capture and reconstruct geometric details.

        "5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS\n",
        "In this paper, we have presented PixelGaussian to learn generalizable 3D Gaussian reconstruction from arbitrary input views. The core innovation of our approach is context-aware Cascade Gaussian Adapter (CGA), which dynamically splits Gaussians in regions with complex geometric details and prunes redundant ones. Further, we incorporate deformable attention within Iterative Gaussian Re- finer (IGR), facilitating direct image-Gaussian interactions to improve local geometry reconstruc- tions. Compared to previous uniform pixel-wise methods, PixelGaussian is able to dynamically adapt both Gaussian distribution and quantity guided by the complexity of local geometry details, allocating more to detailed regions and reducing redundancy across views, thus leading to better performance in reconstruction and view synthesis.\n",
        "Discussions and Limitations. Although PixelGaussian can adjust the distribution of 3D Gaussians dynamically, the initial Gaussians are still derived from pixel-wise unprojection. When we initialize the Gaussian centers completely at random, the model fails to converge. Moreover, deformable attention in IGR consumes substantial computational resources when the number of Gaussians is extremely large, highlighting the need for a more efficient approach to represent 3D scenes with fewer Gaussians. Furthermore, PixelGaussian is unable to perceive the unseen parts of 3D scenes beyond the input views, suggesting the potential need to incorporate generative models.\n",

        "A.1.1 3D GAUSSIAN SPLATTING\n",
        "3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al., 2023) represents a 3D scene as a set of explicit Gaussian prim- itives as follows:\n",
        "G = {gi|gi = (μi, Σi, αi, shi)}Ni=i (10)\n",
        "where each Gaussian has a center μi, a covariance Σi, an opacity αi and spherical harmonics shi. Furthermore, given the scaling matrix S and rotation matrix R, we can calculate the covariance matrix:\n",
        "Σ = RSST RT (11)\n",
        "As explicit Gaussian primitives G can be rendered via an rasterization-based operation, such ap- proach is much more cheaper in both time and memory compared to implicit neural fields ( Milden- hall et al., 2020; Barron et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021a; Garbin et al., 2021) or voxel-based representations( Sitzmann et al., 2019; Ji et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2019; Tatarchenko et al., 2017; Choy et al., 2016).\n",
        "A.1.2 DEFORMABLE ATTENTION\n",
        "Since the introduction of ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), numerous efficient attention mechanisms have been proposed to further enhance the scalability and reduce the complexity of ViT ( Liu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2021b; Yang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2022; Jaegle et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2020; Yue et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021c). Among them, Deformable Attention Transformer (DAT) (Xia et al., 2022) stands out for its ability to effectively capture multi-scale features and adaptively focus on important regions while maintaining lightweight computational overheads. Therefore, we apply deformable attention in both the Score Hypernetworks H (equation 4) and Iterative Gaussian Refiner (IGR) (equation 8) in our PixelGaus- sian model. We elaborate equation 8 as an example.\n",
        "Given Gaussian centers μ, corresponding queries Q, feature maps F = {Fi}Ni=1 and camera param- eters C = {Ci}Ni=1, we first project Gaussian centers to pixel coordinates to get reference points, denote as R = {Ri}Ni=1:\n",
        "Ri = P(μ,Ci),(i = 1,2,...,N) (12) where P(·) denotes projection operation. Next, for Gaussian queries Q, we perform deformable\n",
        "sampling from feature maps F at reference points R using bilinear interpolation as follows: φ(Fi,(rx,ry))= X g(rx,px)·g(ry,py)·Fi(px,py) (13)\n",

        "i=1\n",
        "Wi =softmax(Q·φ(Fi,Ri)T) (15)\n",
        "where αi,(i = 1,2,...,N) represents view weights as illustrated in equation 3. Following this paradigm, we incorporate deformable attention in the score hypernetworks H to generate context- aware thresholds, and in IGR blocks to further refine Gaussian representations using image features.\n",
